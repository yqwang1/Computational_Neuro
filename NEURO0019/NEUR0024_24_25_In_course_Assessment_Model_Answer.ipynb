        "**[5]** Write a function  that asks the user to input a single integer value _N_ using the prompt: “What is the proposed sample size?” Then generate two arrays: “conditions”, which is an N x 1 list of random integers with values of either one or two; and “data”, which is an N x 1 list of random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Compute the difference between the mean of all the values in “data” where the corresponding entry in “conditions” is 1, and the mean of all the values in “data” where the corresponding entry in “conditions” is 2. Store this value as a _float_ variable called “true_diff”. Then randomly shuffle the values in “conditions” and repeat that calculation, one thousand times. Store the difference you compute each time in consecutive entries of an array called “shuffle_diff”. Finally, compute the proportion of values in “shuffle_diff” that are larger / smaller than the value in “true_diff” if “true_diff” is positive / negative, respectively, display this on screen with the text “The shuffled p-value is = …”, and return that value. Run the function one thousand times and compute the proportion of returned values that are < 0.05."
